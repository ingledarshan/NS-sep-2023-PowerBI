MIN:
MIN(column)
returns the smallest value in the column
It can find the min value from columns of following datatypes only: Numbers, Text, Dates, Blanks
When comparing expressions, blank is treated as 0 when comparing. That is, MIN(1, BLANK()) returns 0, and MIN(-1, BLANK()) returns -1.
If both arguments are BLANK, MIN returns a BLANK.

If you want to evaluate a column of TRUE/FALSE values, use the MINA().
