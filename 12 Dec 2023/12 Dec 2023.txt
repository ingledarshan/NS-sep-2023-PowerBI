# CALENDAR vs CALENDARAUTO

>CALENDAR

Syntax:
CALENDAR(startdate, enddate)
Returns a Table with a single column named "Date" that contains a contiguous set of dates.
Returns Error, if startdate>enddate

eg:
CALENDAR(Date(2020,1,1), Date(2021,12,1))

>CALENDARAUTO

Syntax:
CALENDARAUTO([FiscalYearEndMonth])
Note: Whatever we write in square brackets [] is optional.

<FiscalYearEndMonth> Any DAX expression that returns an integer from 1 to 12.
If you mention the number, then it will start from that number to 12 by default.
If omitted, then it will start from minimum value to maximum value in calendar table of current user.

eg:
CALENDARAUTO() - returns all the dates
CALENDARAUTO(3)


Which function should you use?

The function that you should use depends on your specific needs. If you need to generate a table of dates for a specific date range, then you should use the CALENDAR function. If you need to generate a table of dates based on the data in your model, then you should use the CALENDARAUTO function.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when choosing between CALENDAR and CALENDARAUTO:

The CALENDAR function is more flexible than the CALENDARAUTO function, but it is also more complex to use.
The CALENDARAUTO function is easier to use than the CALENDAR function, but it is also less flexible.
The CALENDAR function is more efficient than the CALENDARAUTO function, but it is also more likely to generate errors if your data model is not properly configured.

>COUNT
counts the number of cells in a column that contains non-blank values.
Syntax: COUNT(column)
When the function finds no rows to count, it returns blank.

>COUNTA:
counts the number of cells in a column that are not empty.
Syntax:
COUNTA(column)
When the function finds no rows to count, it returns blank.

COUNT and COUNTA are identical in DAX for all the datatypes except Boolean.

COUNTA can operate on a Boolean type, whereas COUNT cannot do that.
