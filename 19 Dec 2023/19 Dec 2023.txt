Create a dashboard with the Superstore dataset.
Visualizations expected are:
3 cards: Sum of Sales, Sum of Profit, Sum of Qty
Table of Sub-Category, Region wise Sales
Horizontal barchart of Sub-Category wise Sales
Donut chart of Region wise Profit
Donut chart of Segment wise Profit
Donut chart of Category wise Profit
Add a Slicer for States
Give a proper title to the dashboard
The dashboard must have a Dark Theme
All the above must be on a single page, so your alignment skills as a Data Analyst will be judged here. So make sure, you have a meaningful dashboard which your stakeholders will like to see. It must not be a too-cluttered one.
Also publish it to PBI Service and set scheduled refresh to 4pm and 9am.

ALL THE BEST
